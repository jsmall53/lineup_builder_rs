# LineupBuilder

LineupBuilder is a tool for constructing optimized DFS lineups. Currently only supports
[Draft Kings](https://www.draftkings.com), but the plan is to support all major providers.

The optimization engine is located in the [builder](https://github.com/jsmall53/lineup_builder_rs/tree/master/builder) subcrate.

The main crate is an unfinished console application.
